# INParam

A single parameter set for one object, for example face, describing the behaviour of the AI. Each object has default parameters that are set if these are empty.

## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**in_class** | **str** | The classification of the object, that the element refers to. The following is a tree representation of the prototypes and their containing classifications. Default parameter values are defined per classification object. The default values of &#39;min&#39;, &#39;max&#39; and &#39;drawMode&#39; are witten after the name of the classification object in that order. Use the prototype names to set parameters to all of the containing classifications. ##### nudityCheck &gt; _A prototype containing classifications for basic human attributes and sexual contents. This prototype and the containing classifications are activated by default_ * _face_ _(1, 3, 0)_ * _hand_ _(0, -1, 0)_ * _foot_ _(0, -1, 0)_ * _footwear_ _(0, -1, 0)_ * _chest_ _(0, -1, 0)_ * _breast_ _(0, 0, 2)_ * _vulva_ _(0, 0, 2)_ * _penis_ _(0, 0, 2)_ * _vagina_ _(0, 0, 2)_ * _buttocks_ _(0, 0, 2)_ * _anus_ _(0, 0, 2)_ * _toy_ _(0, -1, 0)_ * _oral_ _(0, 0, 2)_ * _penetration_ _(0, 0, 2)_ ##### ageEstimation &gt; _Contains classification objects for estimating the age of a human face. This prototype activates nudityCheck_ * _child (*)_ _(0, 0, 6)_ * _adult (*)_ _(0, -1, 0)_ * _senior (*)_ _(0, -1, 0)_ * _pose_ _(0, 0, 0)_ - The age can not be estimated, due to a pose that hides facial features. ##### attributesCheck &gt; _Contains classification objects for various attributes of the human face. This prototype activates nudityCheck_ * _female (*)_ _(0, -1, 0)_ * _male (*)_ _(0, -1, 0)_ * _hair_ _(0, -1, 0)_ * _hairless_ _(0, -1, 0)_ * _beard_ _(0, -1, 0)_ * _moustache_ _(0, -1, 0)_ * _headpiece_ _(0, -1, 0)_ * _glasses_ _(0, -1, 0)_ * _sunglasses_ _(0, -1, 0)_ * _mask_ _(0, -1, 0)_ ##### nippleCheck &gt; _Contains classifications for determining if the object recognized as breast has a nipple. This prototype activates nudityCheck_ * _noNipple_ _(0, 0, 0)_ * _hasNipple_ _(0, 0, 0)_ ##### illegalSymbols &gt; _Contains various classification objects of symbols that are prohibited in Germany (e.g. Hakenkreuz, SS, etc). These are grouped under a single name_ * _illegalSymbols_ _(0, 0, 1)_ ##### textRecognition &gt; _Contains letters, numbers and some symbols (e.g. @, #, etc) as classification objects. These are grouped under a single name_ * _textRecognition_ _(0, 6, 6)_  _Classification objects that are marked with (*) are sub-classifications of face. Both face and the marked classification are affected by the given parameter values._  _Please be aware that the default values can be subject to change. This is due to the difficulty of recognizing certain objects e.g. objects that are classified as toy._ | [optional] 
**min** | **int** | The minimum amount of objects allowed on the source media. Setting the value to -1 will cause the AI to ignore this rule. | [optional] 
**max** | **int** | The maximum amount of objects allowed on the source media. Setting the value to -1 will cause the AI to ignore this rule. | [optional] 
**severity** | **int** | Set a value to define the severity of a broken rule of the given classification object. | [optional]  if omitted the server will use the default value of 100
**draw_mode** | **int** | The draw mode that will be used for the creating the media.  * _0_ - will draw nothing, * _1_ - will draw a frame with class name surrounding the object, * _2_ - will draw a filled rectangle that will mask the object, * _3_ - is a combination between _1_ and _2_ (frame/name + mask), * _6_ - will blur the object and * _7_ - is a combination between _1_ and _6_ (frame/name + blur). | [optional] 
**grey** | **int** | A grey scale color to use for masking. &#39;0&#39; will represent black, while the maximum &#39;255&#39; will be white. | [optional]  if omitted the server will use the default value of 127
**scale** | **float** | Scale of the draw rectangle around the classification object. Specify a value to increase or decrease the size of the border. | [optional]  if omitted the server will use the default value of 1.0
**any string name** | **bool, date, datetime, dict, float, int, list, str, none_type** | any string name can be used but the value must be the correct type | [optional]
